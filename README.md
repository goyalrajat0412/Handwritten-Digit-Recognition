# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
The objective was to create an identifier for hand-written digits. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, such as self-made architecture and transfer learning were utilised and their effectiveness was validated through appropriate evaluation measures to ultimately develop a relevant classifier for the task at hand.
